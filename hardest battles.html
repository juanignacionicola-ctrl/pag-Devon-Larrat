<h1>his hardest battles</h1>

<p>a battle against Levan Saginashvili is always hard because he is literary a monster of the strenght, the last time they fight Devon lost.  Genida Kvikvinia, it was a very hard battle, Devon won but the rounds were very close with alot of phisical exausted. that incredible fight against Ron Bath was very hard. However, Devon won and he got the WAL in 2013 </p>
